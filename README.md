# Weather App - Android

Weather App is a simple Android application that allows users to get current weather conditions and a 5-day weather forecast based on city names. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays the following information:

- Current temperature and weather description.
- 5-day forecast with daily high and low temperatures.
  
## Features

- **Search for weather by city name**: Users can search for weather conditions by entering the name of a city in the search bar.
- **City list auto-complete**: As users type in the search bar, the app fetches matching city names and shows a list of suggestions.
- **Current weather conditions**: The app displays real-time temperature and a brief weather description.
- **5-day forecast**: The app provides a forecast of high and low temperatures along with weather conditions for the next 5 days.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The app is built using Kotlin for native Android development.
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous network calls are managed using Kotlin coroutines.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **View Binding**: The app uses view binding for easier interaction with views.
- **View Model**: The app uses View model for easier communication with views and data sources.
- **Retrofit**: Network requests are handled using Retrofit, a type-safe HTTP client.
- ## Architecture: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
This project follows the **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to separate concerns and create a scalable and maintainable application structure. Below is an overview of the architecture and how itâ€™s applied in this project:

  
## API Key Setup

To use the app, you need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can sign up for a free API key [here](https://openweathermap.org/).

Once you have the API key, replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key in buildConfigField under project level of BuildGradle in the app.
